1. Webview will not open when selecting a repo from the RepoVC on iPad
2. Animation frames are not quite right.
3. The regex does not recognize the delete key. Not as easy a fix as the \r for enter


Things to implement
in MasterVC
didSelectRowAtIndexPath - dismiss VC when selecting 1 of 3 cells


make searchbar hide when user hits 'enter'
in searchbar clicked
resign first responder


refresh table/collection view when search bar is empty


in the three tableview didselect. modify the split contrtoller view display mode so that on ipad it slides to the left and just shows whatever detail view was selected.






hide collection view when search bar is empty
//        if searchText == "" {
//            self.instructionsLabel.hidden = false
//            self.collectionView.hidden = true
//        }
