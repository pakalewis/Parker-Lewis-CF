check joshua and matt for friendship friday task 2 (post request to github to make a new repo)



in MasterVC
didSelectRowAtIndexPath - dismiss VC when selecting 1 of 3 cells


make searchbar hide when user hits 'enter'
in searchbar clicked
resign first responder


refresh table/collection view when search bar is empty


in the three tableview didselect. modify the split contrtoller view display mode so that on ipad it slides to the left and just shows whatever detail view was selected.


why my web view not triggering from repo vc on ipad?




hide collection view when search bar is empty
//        if searchText == "" {
//            self.instructionsLabel.hidden = false
//            self.collectionView.hidden = true
//        }






WHY does my animatorToSingleUser enlarge the moving image way to the right
the frame is wrong somehow




dont store the user.avatarimage on the collection view
maybe make a cache because they are downloading everytime the cell appears (image is always nil because all the user objects in the array have the image property not set)
